      <description>An extremely simple yet capable compressor circuit is published by Elliott Sound Products, here: http://sound.westhost.com/project45.htm&#xA;Compressor Mk I I built the circuit exactly as-is (in an Altoids tin).&#xA;Care was taken to optically couple the bulb to the photocell (LDR), using a perspex rod, wrapped in smooth tin-foil. The perspex came from eBay: http://stores.ebay.co.uk/thewholesaleposco2009&#xA;as did the miniature &amp;ldquo;Grain of Wheat&amp;rdquo; bulbs: http://stores.ebay.co.uk/GnA-MODELPARTS?_trksid=p2047675.l2563&#xA;This was put together, and sealed in heatshrink tubing, to make it fairly lightproof from external light sources.</description>

      <title>Improving an Ashdown Little Giant bass amplifier</title>

      <description>I have an Ashdown Little Giant amp. Several reviewers have mentioned that this amp is not at loud as it should be (e.g. here).&#xA;It all depends on whether the output levels coming from your bass are enough to drive the output stage fully. I have an active bass, but even with the input set on max, to get a decent output level I need the output volume control set to around 3 o&amp;rsquo;clock.</description>
