      <description>Prototype receiver circuit based on AM26LV32 chip:
The MagJack - aÂ Bel Stewart SI-52008-F has datasheet here: http://www.farnell.com/datasheets/1731561.pdf
The IC cleans up the edges of the incoming signals.
With some level-shifting and AC coupling, the signals are OK to pass into an SPDIF receiver.</description>

      <title>XMOS StartKit - write performance of Sandisk memory card</title>

      <description>Here&amp;rsquo;s a graph showing the write performance to a Sandisk Class 10 memory card.
The reason for the sharp dips in performance, are that the FAT filing system has to go off and allocate a new cluster every N writes. For example 512 byte sectors, 32Kbyte clusters, means a new cluster is needed every 64 writes.
Another factor on the XMOS board is whether the code is running in &amp;lsquo;debug&amp;rsquo; or &amp;lsquo;release&amp;rsquo; mode.</description>

      <title>XMOS StartKit - reading and writing to SD card</title>

      <description>Being able to read/write information from an SD card is probably the easiest way to get large amounts of non-volatile storage into an embedded project. I&amp;rsquo;m using XMOS StartKit, with the code from here
The card reader is a part from Wurth Elektronik, Farnell / CPC part number CN18143 available here.
The data and clock lines have 120 ohm series resistors, as this can help to absorb transmission-line reflections on the connecting wires (even though they are fairly short).</description>

      <title>Rigol DS1054Z digital storage scope - decoding I2S signals</title>

      <description>I recently got one of these great little digital scopes. It has a few serial bus decoding packages (on a try-before-buy basis). You get 36 hours to play with them. Unfortunately they don&amp;rsquo;t include I2S bus decoding. I2S is a bus standard commonly used for transferring digital audio around, for example between ADCs and DACs.
No matter! You can capture and export full-resolution traces of signals via a USB memory stick.</description>
