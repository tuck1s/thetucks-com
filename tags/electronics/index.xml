      <description>The following circuit is a very simple water leak detector, which I made 25+ years ago (!!) following my fianc√©e having a washing machine go wrong and leak all over her apartment.
The circuit is not ideal - there are better designs out there. It was built with &amp;lsquo;what I had in my scrapbox at the time&amp;rsquo;. It&amp;rsquo;s purely analog, relying on the gain of the Darlington pair to provide reasonable on/off behaviour.</description>
